# SplitStreams Survey
Here you can find the survey conducted for the evaluation of [SplitStreams](https://github.com/cadanox/SplitStreams), a visualization of dynamic hierarchies.
Users were split into 3 groups: Treemaps, Nested Streamgraphs, and SplitStreams. The surveys varied accordingly and can be inspected in the files
- [Survey-treemap.html](Survey-treemap.html)
- [Survey-stream.html](Survey-stream.html)
- [Survey-secstream.html](Survey-secstream.html)

The raw results of our user study can be inspected in the file [results.csv](results.csv). For a detailed analysis of the results, please refer to [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.2973564).
